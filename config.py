During 2024, a total of 3,269 cases of acute hepatitis A, 3,192 cases of acute hepatitis B, and 4,090 cases of hepatitis C were reported to CDC through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). Compared with 2023, reported cases of acute hepatitis A decreased 12%, acute hepatitis B increased 8%, and hepatitis C increased 15%.

Geographic Distribution: Highest rates of hepatitis A were observed in Kentucky (8.2 cases per 100,000 population), West Virginia (7.8), and Indiana (6.9). The national rate was 1.0 cases per 100,000 population.

Age Distribution: Among hepatitis A cases, 68% occurred among adults aged 30-59 years. For hepatitis B, 45% occurred among adults aged 30-49 years.

Recommendations: Vaccination programs should target high-risk populations, including men who have sex with men, persons who use injection drugs, and international travelers.""",
