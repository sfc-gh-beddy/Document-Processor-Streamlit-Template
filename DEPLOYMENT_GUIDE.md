# üöÄ Customer Deployment Guide

This guide helps you quickly deploy and customize the Document AI Platform for your specific use case.

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ‚úÖ Snowflake Requirements
- [ ] Snowflake account with Cortex AI enabled
- [ ] Database and schema created
- [ ] File upload stage configured  
- [ ] Document AI model trained or available
- [ ] User permissions configured

### ‚úÖ Application Files
- [ ] All template files copied to your environment
- [ ] `config.py` updated with your settings
- [ ] Template files renamed (remove `_template` suffix)
- [ ] Semantic model YAML created for your data

## üîß Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Database Setup (5 minutes)

```sql
-- Create your database and schema
CREATE DATABASE YOUR_DATABASE_NAME;
USE DATABASE YOUR_DATABASE_NAME;
CREATE SCHEMA YOUR_SCHEMA_NAME;
USE SCHEMA YOUR_SCHEMA_NAME;

-- Create file upload stage
CREATE STAGE YOUR_STAGE_NAME;

-- Verify stage creation
DESC STAGE YOUR_STAGE_NAME;
```

### Step 2: Configure Application (10 minutes)

Edit `config.py` and replace these key variables:

```python
# üè¢ ORGANIZATION SETTINGS
DATABASE_NAME = "FINANCIAL_DOCS"           # Your database
SCHEMA_NAME = "PROCESSING"                 # Your schema
STAGE_NAME = "FINANCIAL_DOCS.PROCESSING.UPLOADS"  # Your stage

# üéØ DOMAIN CUSTOMIZATION  
APP_TITLE = "Financial Document AI"       # Your app name
DOMAIN_NAME = "Financial Document Processing"  # Your domain
DOCUMENT_TYPE = "financial documents"     # Your document types
PRIMARY_USE_CASE = "financial data analysis"  # Your use case

# ü§ñ AI MODEL CONFIGURATION
DOCUMENT_AI_MODEL = "FINANCIAL_DOCS.PROCESSING.INVOICE_EXTRACTOR!PREDICT"

# üìä SEMANTIC MODEL
SEMANTIC_MODEL_FILE = "@FINANCIAL_DOCS.PROCESSING.UPLOADS/financial_model.yaml"
```

### Step 3: Customize Extraction Schema (5 minutes)

Update the extraction questions for your domain:

```python
DEFAULT_EXTRACTION_SCHEMA = {
    "vendor_name": "What is the vendor or supplier name?",
    "invoice_number": "What is the invoice number?", 
    "invoice_date": "What is the invoice date?",
    "total_amount": "What is the total amount?",
    "tax_amount": "What is the tax amount?",
    "due_date": "What is the payment due date?",
    "line_items": "List: What are the line items?",
    "payment_terms": "What are the payment terms?",
    "purchase_order": "What is the purchase order number?",
    "account_codes": "List: What account codes are mentioned?"
}
```

### Step 4: Create Semantic Model (15 minutes)

Create `your_domain_model.yaml`:

```yaml
name: financial_document_model
tables:
  - name: FINANCIAL_EXTRACTIONS
    base_table:
      database: FINANCIAL_DOCS
      schema: PROCESSING
      table: INVOICE_DATA_FLATTENED
    dimensions:
      - name: VENDOR_NAME
        expr: VENDOR_NAME
        data_type: VARCHAR
        description: Name of the vendor or supplier
        synonyms: [supplier, company, vendor]
      - name: INVOICE_DATE  
        expr: INVOICE_DATE
        data_type: DATE
        description: Date of the invoice
        synonyms: [date, invoice_date, bill_date]
    facts:
      - name: TOTAL_AMOUNT
        expr: TOTAL_AMOUNT  
        data_type: NUMBER(12,2)
        description: Total invoice amount
        synonyms: [amount, total, cost, price]
      - name: TAX_AMOUNT
        expr: TAX_AMOUNT
        data_type: NUMBER(12,2) 
        description: Tax amount on invoice
        synonyms: [tax, vat, sales_tax]
```

Upload to Snowflake:
```sql
PUT file://your_domain_model.yaml @YOUR_STAGE_NAME;
```

### Step 5: File Rename and Deploy (2 minutes)

```bash
# Rename template files
mv streamlit_app_template.py streamlit_app.py
mv pages/DocumentProcessor_template.py pages/DocumentProcessor.py
mv pages/AI_EXTRACT_template.py pages/AI_EXTRACT.py  
mv pages/NaturalLanguageChatBot_template.py pages/NaturalLanguageChatBot.py

# Test locally
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## üé® Quick Customization Examples

### Financial Services
```python
APP_TITLE = "Financial Document AI"
DOMAIN_NAME = "Financial Processing"
DOCUMENT_TYPE = "invoices, statements, and reports"
PRIMARY_USE_CASE = "financial data extraction"

DEFAULT_EXTRACTION_SCHEMA = {
    "vendor": "What is the vendor name?",
    "amount": "What is the total amount?", 
    "date": "What is the invoice date?",
    "account": "What is the account number?",
    "description": "What services were provided?"
}
```

### Healthcare  
```python
APP_TITLE = "Medical Records AI"
DOMAIN_NAME = "Healthcare Document Processing"
DOCUMENT_TYPE = "medical records and reports"
PRIMARY_USE_CASE = "clinical data extraction"

DEFAULT_EXTRACTION_SCHEMA = {
    "patient_id": "What is the patient ID?",
    "diagnosis": "What is the primary diagnosis?",
    "medications": "List: What medications are prescribed?",
    "provider": "Who is the healthcare provider?",
    "visit_date": "What is the visit date?"
}
```

### Legal Documents
```python
APP_TITLE = "Legal Document AI"  
DOMAIN_NAME = "Legal Document Processing"
DOCUMENT_TYPE = "contracts and legal documents"
PRIMARY_USE_CASE = "legal data extraction"

DEFAULT_EXTRACTION_SCHEMA = {
    "parties": "List: Who are the parties in this contract?",
    "effective_date": "What is the effective date?",
    "term_length": "What is the contract term?",
    "value": "What is the contract value?",
    "obligations": "List: What are the key obligations?"
}
```

## üîç Testing Your Deployment

### Test Document Processor
1. Upload a sample PDF document
2. Verify processing pipeline completes
3. Check that data appears in your tables

### Test AI Extract  
1. Try the file upload tab with a sample document
2. Test the text input tab with sample text
3. Verify results are saved to database

### Test Natural Language Chat
1. Ask a simple question about your data
2. Verify SQL generation works
3. Check that visualizations display correctly

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Configuration Issues

**Database Connection Errors:**
```python
# Verify these settings in config.py
DATABASE_NAME = "YOUR_ACTUAL_DATABASE"  # Must exist in Snowflake
SCHEMA_NAME = "YOUR_ACTUAL_SCHEMA"      # Must exist in database
```

**Stage Access Errors:**
```sql
-- Check stage exists and has permissions
DESC STAGE YOUR_STAGE_NAME;
SHOW GRANTS ON STAGE YOUR_STAGE_NAME;
```

**Model Not Found Errors:**
```python
# Verify model exists and is accessible
DOCUMENT_AI_MODEL = "DATABASE.SCHEMA.MODEL_NAME!PREDICT"  # Full path required
```

**Semantic Model Errors:**
```sql
-- Verify file uploaded correctly
LIST @YOUR_STAGE_NAME;

-- Check file contents
SELECT $1 FROM @YOUR_STAGE_NAME/your_model.yaml;
```

### Performance Optimization

**Large File Processing:**
- Increase timeout values in processing functions
- Consider file size limits in configuration
- Implement chunking for very large documents

**Database Performance:**
- Add indexes on frequently queried columns
- Consider partitioning large tables by date
- Optimize semantic model for common queries
